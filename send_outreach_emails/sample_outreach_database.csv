Functional connectivity of the brain is dynamic; it changes over time due to different causes such as learning, or quitting a habit. Functional connectivity analysis is useful in discovering and comparing patterns between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of patients' brains. In the resting state, the patient is asked to remain calm and not do any task to minimize the contribution of external stimuli. The study of resting-state fMRI networks have shown functionally connected brain regions that have a high level of activity during this state. In this project, we are interested in the relationship between these functionally connected brain regions to identify nicotine dependent patients, who underwent a smoking cessation treatment. Our approach is on the comparison of the set of connections between the fMRI scans before and after treatment. We applied support vector machines, a machine learning technique, to classify patients based on receiving the treatment or the placebo. Using the functional connectivity (CONN) toolbox, we were able to form a correlation matrix based on the functional connectivity between different regions of the brain. The experimental results show that there is inadequate predictive information to classify nicotine dependent patients using the SVM classifier. We propose other classification methods be explored to better classify the nicotine dependent patients.",2021/12/8,17cc7ac88c9ecce8,2021/12/28,1,

The aim of the study was to better understand specific characteristics of the intrinsic whole-brain-network architecture of 34 AUD patients that may support abstinence or relapse. We used Graph Theory Analysis (GTA) of resting-state fMRI data from treatment seekers at 1 month of abstinence and their follow-up data as abstainers or relapsers 3 months later, together with data from 30 light/non-drinking controls scanned at the same interval. We determined the group-specific intrinsic community configurations at both timepoints as well as the corresponding modularity Q, a GTA measure that quantifies how well individual network communities are separated from each other. Both AUD groups at both timepoints had community configurations significantly different from those of controls, but the three groups did not significantly differ in their Q values. However, relapsers showed a maladaptive community configuration at baseline, which became more similar to the controls' community organization after the relapsers had started consuming alcohol again during the study interval. Additionally, successful recovery from AUD was not associated with re-gaining the intrinsic brain organization found in light/non-drinkers, but with a re-configuration resulting in a new brain organization distinctly different from that of healthy controls. Resting-state fMRI provides useful measures reflecting neuroplastic adaptations related to AUD treatment outcome.",2021/10/28,17cc7ac8b2dea84e,2021/11/17,0,DAT need to be done with VA
OPI,Sustained opioid antagonism modulates striatal sensitivity to baby schema in opioid use disorder,J. Subst. Abus.

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these deficits and their response to treatment are not well understood. Baby schema (Kindchenschema) is a set of juvenile physical features, which is perceived as cute and triggers motivation for caregiving. Recent studies suggest that the baby schema effect is mediated by the brain reward network. We studied the impact of opioid antagonist treatment on the baby schema response in patients with opioid use disorder. Methods: Forty-seven (24 F) recently detoxified patients with opioid use disorder underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing infant portraits that were parametrically manipulated for baby schema content and rating them for cuteness, at baseline and during treatment with the injectable extended release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XRNTX). The study was not placebo-controlled. Results: The behavioral effect of baby schema, indexed by cuteness ratings, was present and unaffected by XRNTX. The brain response to baby schema was absent at baseline, but present in the bilateral ventral striatum after two weeks of XRNTX treatment. The decline in self-reported craving for opioids was positively correlated with the brain fMRI response to baby schema in the bilateral ventral striatum. Conclusions: Opioid antagonist treatment modulated the brain reward system response to a marker of caregiving motivation in patients with opioid use disorder. Neural response to baby schema may offer a novel probe of social motivation and affiliative behaviors in this population. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Thus, identifying treatments that target SC-elicited craving is a top research priority. Reduced drug cue neural activity is associated with recovery and is marked by a profile of greater tonic (resting) activation in executive control regions, and increased connectivity between executive and salience regions. Evidence suggests the GABA-B agonist baclofen can reduce drug cue-elicited neural activity, potentially through its actions on the resting brain. Based on the literature, we hypothesize that baclofen's effects in the resting brain can predict its effects during SC exposure. Methods: In this longitudinal, double blind, placebo-controlled neuropharmacological study 43 non-abstinent, sated treatment-seeking cigarette smokers (63% male) participated in an fMRI resting-state scan and a SC-reactivity task prior to (T1) and 3 weeks following randomization (T2; baclofen: 80 mg/day; n = 21). Subjective craving reports were acquired before and after SC exposure to explicitly examine SC-induced craving. Results: Whole-brain full-factorial analysis revealed a group-by-time interaction with greater resting brain activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) at T2 in the baclofen group (BAC) (p(FwEcorr) = 0.02), which was associated with reduced neural responses to SCs in key cue-reactive brain regions; the anterior ventral insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (p(FwEcorr) < 0.01). BAC, but not the placebo group reported decreased SC-elicited craving (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Results suggest that baclofen mitigates the reward response to SCs through an increase in tonic activation of the dIPFC, an executive control region. Through these mechanisms, baclofen may offer SC-vulnerable smokers protection from SC-induced relapse.",2021/12/8,17cc7ac8cd99744e,2021/12/28,1,

Identifying youth who may engage in future substance use could facilitate early identification of substance use disorder vulnerability. We aimed to identify biomarkers that predicted future substance use in psychiatrically un-well youth. Method. LASSO regression for variable selection was used to predict substance use 24.3 months after neuroimaging assessment in 73 behaviorally and emotionally dysregulated youth aged 13.9 (s.d. = 2.0) years, 30 female, from three clinical sites in the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study. Predictor variables included neural activity during a reward task, cortical thickness, and clinical and demographic variables. Results. Future substance use was associated with higher left middle prefrontal cortex activity, lower left ventral anterior insula activity, thicker caudal anterior cingulate cortex, higher depression and lower mania scores, not using antipsychotic medication, more parental stress, older age. This combination of variables explained 60.4% of the variance in future substance use, and accurately classified 83.6%. Conclusions. These variables explained a large proportion of the variance, were useful classifiers of future substance use, and showed the value of combining multiple domains to provide a comprehensive understanding of substance use development.

Decisions to abandon or persist towards a goal after negative emotion-eliciting events, and neural responses that shape such decisions, may be important in maintaining recovery from POUD. Objectives: We examined differences in neural responses to negative events and subsequent persistence decisions in individuals recovering from POUD without a history of a substance use disorder. Methods: 20 individuals with POUD (POUD group: 4 females, abstinent 2-3 weeks after admission to an inpatient treatment facility post-detoxification, no other substance use disorder), and 20 individuals with no substance use history (control group: 6 females) completed a persistence-after-setbacks task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants advanced along a path toward a reward; after encountering each negative event (i.e., progress-erasing setback), participants made decisions to persist or abandon the path. Persistence decision rates were compared between groups and blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal to negative events was analyzed within a striatum region of interest (ROI) as well as whole-brain. Results: The POUD group persisted less (t(38) = 2.293, p = .028, d = .725) and showed lower striatum (left ventral putamen) signal to negative events compared to the control group (p < .05, corrected for striatum ROI). Conclusions: In POUD, neural and behavioral responses to negative events differ from controls. These differences are a target for research to address whether POUD treatment increases persistence and striatum responses to negative events and improves recovery outcomes.",2021/12/8,17cc7ac8e29bc3eb,2021/12/28,1,

The present study evaluated the alteration of gray matter volume (GMV) and its resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) among male heroin users. MethodsThirty heroin-dependent men undergoing methadone maintenance therapy and 30 educational-level- and age-matched male controls were recruited for this study. To assess their GMV and rsFC, the participants were evaluated using spoiled gradient echo and gradient-recalled echo planar imaging sequences with a 3-Tesla General Electric MR scanner under resting state. ResultsThe heroin-dependent men showed lower GMV over the right DLPFC in comparison with the controls. Further evaluation of the rsFC of the right DLPFC revealed a marked decrease in interhemispheric DLPFC connectivity among those with heroin dependence under control of head movement and GMV of the right DLPFC. ConclusionAlthough the mechanism remains unclear, the present study shows that chronic heroin use is associated with alteration of morphology as well as rsFC over the right DLPFC. As the DLPFC plays an imperative role in various domains of cognitive function, service providers for heroin users should consider the impacts of possible DLPFC-related cognitive deficits on treatment effectiveness.",2021/12/8,17cc7ac90f1c5f0d,2021/12/28,1,

While stable performance may be beneficial in some situations, others require flexible updating of task demands. Frontoparietal networks, basal ganglia and thalamus contribute to an optimal balance of stable and flexible performance. We aimed to test how the cholinergic agonist nicotine modulates this balance and used an ongoing visual task including switch and distractor trials to gauge cognitive flexibility and stability respectively. Young healthy non-smokers (n = 39) received either a 7 mg transdermal nicotine or placebo patch in a double-blind, within-subject design one hour prior to performing the task in a 3 T MR scanner. Nicotine enhanced response times in all task conditions but did not significantly impact distractor or switch costs. Neurally, there was no significant nicotine induced modulation of distractoror switch-related activity on group level. However, a brain-behaviour correlation analysis revealed that the nicotine-induced alterations of distractor costs correlated positively with distractor-related neural activity in the right intraparietal sulcus and the right pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. We suggest that a nicotinic contribution to balancing stability and flexibility is weak in young healthy non-smokers. The brain-behaviour correlations imply that if nicotine reduces distractor interference, the modulation is found in thalamic-parietal networks. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FIND) was used to assess the nicotine dependence level. The bilateral thalamic RSFC patterns were compared between smokers and non-smokers. The relationship between neuroimaging findings and smoking behaviors (FIND and pack years) were also investigated in smokers. Relative to nonsmokers, smokers showed reduced RSFC strength between the left thalamus and several brain regions, i.e. the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the bilateral caudate. In addition, the right thalamus showed reduced RSFC with the right dIPFC as well as the bilateral insula in smokers. Therefore, the findings in the current study revealed the reduced RSFC of the thalamus with the dIPFC, the ACC, the insula and the caudate in smokers, which provided new insights into the roles of the thalamus in nicotine addiction from a function integration perspective.

This study aims to examine whether individual differences in affect and brain volume prospectively predict alcohol-related problems in adolescence.

Pre-existing differences in the left ACC predicted problem drinking. Alcohol-related problems were associated with higher levels of temperamental negative affectivity; however, these were not correlated with anterior cingulate volumes. These findings indicate that individual differences in the structural morphology of the anterior cingulate, a region implicated in affective processes, self-control, and drug addiction, predict later alcohol-related problems.

In alcohol use disorders, profound brain structural deficits can be found in severe alcoholic patients, but the heterogeneity of unimodal MRI measurements has so far precluded the identification of selective biomarkers, especially for early diagnosis. In the present work we used a combination of multiple MRI modalities to provide comprehensive and insightful descriptions of brain tissue microstructure. We performed a longitudinal experiment using Marchigian-Sardinian (msP) rats, an established model of chronic excessive alcohol consumption, and acquired multi-modal images before and after 1 month of alcohol consumption (6.8 +/- 1.4 g/kg/day, mean +/- SD), as well as after 1 week of abstinence with or without concomitant treatment with the antirelapse opioid antagonist naltrexone (2.5mg/kg/day). We found remarkable sensitivity and selectivity to accurately classify brains affected by alcohol even after the relative short exposure period. One month drinking was enough to imprint a highly specific signature of alcohol consumption. Brain alterations were regionally specific and affected both gray and white matter and persisted into the early abstinence state without any detectable recovery. Interestingly, naltrexone treatment during early abstinence resulted in subtle brain changes that could be distinguished from non-treated abstinent brains, suggesting the existence of an intermediate state associated with brain recovery from alcohol exposure induced by medication.

Although unanticipated, these anatomical findings raise questions regarding possible treatment that could even ultimately require neurosurgical intervention, which itself carries significant risk but may not be indicated if the anomaly is nonprogressive or of no functional consequence. Neuroradiological readings of 833 structural MRI from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) cohort found an 11.8 % incidence of brain structural anomalies, represented proportionately across the five collection sites and ethnic groups. Anomalies included 26 mega cisterna magna, 15 subarachnoid cysts, 12 pineal cysts, 12 white matter dysmorphologies, 5 tonsillar ectopias, 5 prominent perivascular spaces, 5 gray matter heterotopias, 4 pituitary masses, 4 excessively large or asymmetrical ventricles, 4 cavum septum pellucidum, 3 developmental venous anomalies, 1 exceptionally large midsagittal vein, and single cases requiring clinical followup: cranio-cervical junction stenosis, parietal cortical mass, and Chiari I malformation. A case of possible demyelinating disorder (e.g., neuromyelitis optica or multiple sclerosis) newly emerged at the 1-year NCANDA followup, requiring clinical referral. Comparing test performance of the 98 anomalous cases with 619 anomaly-free no-to-low alcohol consuming adolescents revealed significantly lower scores on speed measures of attention and motor functions; these differences were not attributed to any one anomaly subgroup. Further, we devised an automated approach for quantifying posterior fossa CSF volumes for detection of mega cisterna magna, which represented 26.5 % of clinically identified anomalies. Automated quantification fit a Gaussian distribution with a rightward skew. Using a 3SD cut-off, quantification identified 22 of the 26 clinically-identified cases, indicating that cases with percent of CSF in the posterior-inferior-middle aspect of the posterior fossa >= 3SD merit further review, and support complementing clinical readings with objective quantitative analysis. Discovery of asymptomatic brain structural anomalies, even when no clinical action is indicated, can be disconcerting to the individual and responsible family members, raising a disclosure dilemma: refrain from relating the incidental findings to avoid unnecessary alarm or anxiety; or alternatively, relate the neuroradiological findings as normal variants to the study volunteers and family, thereby equipping them with knowledge for the future should they have the occasion for a brain scan following an illness or accident that the incidental findings predated the later event.",2021/12/8,17cc7ac997c4b3fb,2021/12/28,1,

Results: Individuals with AD demonstrated significantly reduced VMHC in bilateral cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) and increased VMHC in bilateral middle frontal gyms (MFG) compared to that in HCs in the typical and slow-4 bands; higher VMHC in the MFG was positively correlated with the dependence-severity score. In all bands of the VMHC analysis, no significant differences were found between the AND and other groups. Subsequent seed-based FC analysis demonstrated all regions with abnormal VMHC exhibited altered FC with its counterpart in the contralateral hemisphere in the typical and slow-4 frequency bands. The FC value between bilateral CPL within AD subjects negatively correlated with alcohol intake. Conclusion: Our findings provide further evidence of the role of disruptions within the brain circuitry supporting cognitive control in the development of AD. Alterations in neural activities in the CPL and MFG might be a biomarker of dependence severity in AD patients as assessed using clinical questionnaire and features. Because of the frequency specificity in VMHC, we must consider frequency effects in future AD functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.",2021/12/8,17cc7ac9b0aba1f6,2021/12/28,1,

We examined whether self-efficacy can affect the neural response to smoking cues in smokers and ex-smokers using functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, participants were instructed (1) to view smoking-related images passively, (2) to view the smoking-related images with a strategy focused on self-efficacy to control cue-induced craving or (3) to view neutral images. In smokers, the self-efficacy strategy significantly reduced self-reported craving. This strategy was related to increased activation in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex in smokers compared with ex-smokers. Furthermore, smokers showed increased effective connectivity between rmPFC and hippocampus and between pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampus gyrus when employing the self-efficacy strategy compared with ex-smokers.

Method: Functional MRI was conducted on 30 smokers and 30 non-smokers while mentally simulating neutral and smoking hand movements. Smoking cue and mental simulation processing-related changes in functional connectivity strengths of the subcallosal and posterior cingulate cortex (SCC and PCC) with major brain network nodes were examined. Results: Compared to non-smokers, smokers showed cue-induced SCC functional connectivities which were enhanced with the intraparietal sulcus and reduced with the medial prefrontal cortex. The PCC activation and functional connectivity enhancements with the anterior insula cortex and rostro-lateral prefrontal cortex was found during smoking mental simulation. The PCC-lateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity correlated with nicotine dependence severity. Conclusion: The present results demonstrate that smokers can be identified by cue-induced SCC functional connectivity strength decline and increment in the default mode and dorsal attention network nodes.

Personality and behavioral characteristics including impulsivity, anger, reward sensitivity, and avoidance were assessed in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 475). Participants also underwent diffusion tensor imaging for the analysis of structural brain networks. A data-driven clustering using personality and behavioral traits of the participants identified four subtypes. As compared with individuals clustered into the neutral type, individuals with a high level of impulsivity (A subtype) and those with high levels of reward sensitivity, impulsivity, anger, and avoidance (B subtype) showed significant associations with problem drinking. In contrast, individuals with high levels of impulsivity, anger, and avoidance but not reward sensitivity (C subtype) showed a pattern of social drinking that was similar to those of the neutral subtype. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis with ridge estimators was applied to demonstrate the neurobiological relevance for the identified subtypes according to distinct patterns of structural brain connectivity within the addiction circuitry [neutral vs. A subtype, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.81; neutral vs. B subtype, AUC = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.66-0.82; neutral vs. C subtype, AUC = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.70-0.84].

Rodent research shows opioid effects on reciprocal inhibition between maternal care and defence maternal brain subsystems: the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray, respectively. We conducted a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pilot study in humans to specifically examine resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) between the periaqueductal gray and hypothalamus, as well as to explore associations with maternal bonding for BT. We studied 32 mothers who completed fMRI scans at 1 month (T1) and 4 months postpartum (T2), including seven mothers receiving buprenorphine for OUD and 25 non-OUD mothers as a comparison group (CG). The participants underwent a 6-minute resting-state fMRI scan at each time point. We measured potential bonding impairments using the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire to explore how rs-FC with periaqueductal gray is associated with bonding impairments. Compared to CG, BT mothers differed in periaqueductal gray-dependent rs-FC with the hypothalamus, amygdala, insular cortex and other brain regions at T1, with many of these differences disappearing at T2, suggesting potential therapeutic effects of continuing buprenorphine treatment. In contrast, the rejection and pathological anger subscale of the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire at T1 and T2 was associated with the T1-to-T2 increases in periaqueductal gray-dependent rs-FC with the hypothalamus and amygdala. Preliminary evidence links maternal bonding problems for mothers with OUD early in the postpartum to connectivity between specific care and defence maternal brain circuits, which may be mitigated by buprenorphine treatment.

Neuroimaging studies suggest that these behavioral components correspond to an increased involvement of regions that mediate appetitive drive and reduced involvement of regions that mediate executive control within top-down networks. Little is known, however, about whether these characteristics are present after long periods of abstinence. Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected to examine resting-state synchrony (RSS) differences between 23 long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAA; 8 women, age: M = 48.46, SD = 7.10), and 23 nonsubstance abusing controls (NSAC; 8 women, age: M = 47.99, SD = 6.70). Using seed-based measures, we examined RSS with the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). All participants were assessed with the intra/extradimensional set shift task outside of the scanner to explore the relationship between RSS and cognitive flexibility. Results Compared to NSAC, LTAA showed (i) decreased synchrony of limbic reward regions (e.g., caudate and thalamus) with both the anterior cingulate cortex seed and the NAcc seed and (ii) increased synchrony of executive control regions (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) with both the NAcc seed and the sgACC seed. RSS differences were significantly correlated with task performance. Conclusions The results are consistent with an interpretation of an ongoing compensatory mechanism in LTAA evident during rest, in which decision-making networks show reduced synchrony with appetitive drive regions and increased synchrony with inhibitory control regions. In addition, RSS differences were associated with cognitive flexibility. These resting-state findings indicate an adaptive mechanism present in long-term abstinence that may facilitate the behavioral control required to maintain abstinence.",2021/10/28,17cc7aca5a3729e6,2021/11/17,0,email not found

Prior work has linked reduced interhemispheric executive control network (ECN) coupling with poor executive function, shorter time to relapse, and greater substance use. Lower structural connectivity between a key ECN hub, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the dorsal striatum (DS) also contributes to less efficient cognitive control recruitment, and reduced intrahemispheric connectivity between these regions has been associated with smoking relapse. Therefore, sex differences were probed by evaluating interhemispheric ECN and intrahemispheric DLPFC-DS connectivity. To assess the potential sex by nicotine interaction, a pilot sample of non-smokers was evaluated following acute nicotine and placebo administration. Methods: Thirty-five smokers (19 women) completed one resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Seventeen non-smokers (8 women) were scanned twice using a repeated measures design where they received 2 and 0 mg nicotine. Results: In smokers, women had less interhemispheric ECN and DLPFC-DS coupling than men. In non-smokers, there was a drug x sex interaction where women, relative to men, had weaker ECN coupling following nicotine but not placebo administration. Conclusions: The current work indicates that nicotine-dependent women, versus men, have weaker connectivity in brain networks critically implicated in cognitive control. How these connectivity differences contribute to the behavioral aspects of smoking requires more testing. However, building on the literature, it is likely these deficits in functional connectivity contribute to the lower abstinence rates noted in women relative to men.",2021/12/8,17cc7aca7a1516f1,2021/12/28,1,

Although the association between ACC and behavior has been established, it is less clear how ACC contributes to dysfunctional behavior such as substance dependence. Evidence from neuroimaging studies investigating ACC function in substance users is mixed, with some studies showing disengagement of ACC in substance dependent individuals (SDs), while others show increased ACC activity related to substance use. In this study, we investigate ACC function in SDs and healthy individuals performing a change signal task for monetary rewards. Using a priori predictions derived from a recent computational model of ACC, we find that ACC activity differs between SDs and controls in factors related to reward salience and risk aversion between SDs and healthy individuals. Quantitative fits of a computational model to fMRI data reveal significant differences in best fit parameters for reward salience and risk preferences. Specifically, the ACC in SDs shows greater risk aversion, defined as concavity in the utility function, and greater attention to rewards relative to reward omission. Furthermore, across participants risk aversion and reward salience are positively correlated. The results clarify the role that ACC plays in both the reduced sensitivity to omitted rewards and greater reward valuation in SDs.

Most research has focused on neuropathological effects of alcohol that appear after years of chronic alcohol misuse. However, few studies have investigated white matter (WM) microstructure and diffusion MRI-based (DWI) connectivity during early stages of AUD. Therefore, the goal of this work was to investigate WM integrity and structural connectivity in emerging adulthood AUD subjects using both conventional DWI metrics and a novel connectomics approach. Methods Twenty-two AUD and 18 controls (CON) underwent anatomic and diffusion MRI. Outcome measures were scalar diffusion metrics and structural network connectomes. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to investigate group differences in diffusion measures. Structural connectomes were used as input into a community structure procedure to obtain a coclassification index matrix (an indicator of community association strength) for each subject. Differences in coclassification and structural connectivity (indexed by streamline density) were assessed via the Network Based Statistics Toolbox. Results AUD had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values throughout the major WM tracts, but also had lower FA values in WM tracts in the cerebellum and right insula (p(TFCE) < 0.05). Mean diffusivity was generally lower in the AUD group (p(TFCE) < 0.05). AUD had lower coclassification of nodes between ventral attention and default mode networks and higher coclassification between nodes of visual, default mode, and somatomotor networks. Additionally, AUD had higher fiber density between an adjacent pair of nodes within the default mode network. Conclusions Our results indicate that emerging adulthood AUD subjects may have differential patterns of FA and distinct differences in structural connectomes compared with CON. These data suggest that such alterations in microstructure and structural connectivity may uniquely characterize early stages of AUD and/or a predisposition for development of AUD.",2021/12/8,17cc7acaa9b39235,2021/12/28,1,

The current study is a secondary analysis examining whether alcohol cue-induced activation in the ventral striatum is predictive of subsequent alcohol self-administration in the laboratory. Methods Non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers of East Asian descent (n = 41) completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover experiment on the effects of naltrexone on neuroimaging and human laboratory paradigms. Participants completed 5 days of study medication (or placebo); on day 4, they completed a neuroimaging alcohol taste cue-reactivity task. On the following day (day 5), participants completed a 60-minute alcohol self-administration paradigm. Results Multilevel Cox regressions indicated a significant effect of taste cue-elicited ventral striatum activation on latency to first drink, Wald chi(2) = 2.88, p = 0.05, such that those with higher ventral striatum activation exhibited shorter latencies to consume their first drink. Similarly, ventral striatum activation was positively associated with total number of drinks consumed, F(1, 38) = 5.90, p = 0.02. These effects were significant after controlling for alcohol use severity, OPRM1 genotype, and medication. Other potential regions of interest (anterior cingulate, thalamus) were not predictive of self-administration outcomes. Conclusions Neuroimaging alcohol taste cue paradigms may be predictive of laboratory paradigms such as self-administration. Elucidation of the relationships among different paradigms will inform how these paradigms may be used synergistically in experimental medicine and medication development.",2021/12/8,17cc7acad75f22ab,2021/12/28,1,

Altered function in neural reward circuitry is thought to increase the risk for AUD. To test the hypothesis that adolescent alcohol misuse primes the brain for alcohol-related psychopathology in early adulthood, we examined whether adolescent alcohol consumption rates predicted reward responsivity in the ventral striatum (VS), and in turn, AUD symptoms in adulthood. Methods A total of 139 low income, racially diverse urban males reported on their alcohol use at ages 11, 12, 15, and 17; completed self-reports of personality, psychiatric interviews, and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan at age 20; and completed a psychiatric interview at age 22. We measured adolescent alcohol use trajectories using latent growth curve modeling and measured neural responses to monetary reward using a VS region of interest. We tested indirect effects of adolescent alcohol use on AUD symptoms at age 22 via VS reward-related reactivity at age 20. Results Greater acceleration in adolescent alcohol use predicted increased VS response during reward anticipation at age 20. VS reactivity to reward anticipation at age 20 predicted AUD symptoms at age 22, over and above concurrent symptoms. Accelerated adolescent alcohol use predicted AUD symptoms in early adulthood via greater VS reactivity to reward anticipation. Conclusions Prospective findings support a pathway through which adolescent alcohol use increases the risk for AUD in early adulthood by impacting reward-related neural functioning. These results highlight increased VS reward-related reactivity as a biomarker for AUD vulnerability.",2021/12/8,17cc7acaf0a6dd22,2021/12/28,1,

One particular hope associated with multimodal neuroimaging is the development of reliable data-driven diagnostic classifiers for psychiatric disorders, yet previous studies have often failed to find a benefit of combining multiple modalities. As a psychiatric disorder with established neurobiological effects at several levels of description, alcohol dependence is particularly well-suited for multimodal classification. To this aim, we developed a multimodal classification scheme and applied it to a rich neuroimaging battery (structural, functional task-based and functional resting-state data) collected in a matched sample of alcohol-dependent patients (N = 119) and controls (N = 97). We found that our classification scheme yielded 79.3% diagnostic accuracy, which outperformed the strongest individual modality - grey-matter density - by 2.7%. We found that this moderate benefit of multimodal classification depended on a number of critical design choices: a procedure to select optimal modality-specific classifiers, a fine-grained ensemble prediction based on cross-modal weight matrices and continuous classifier decision values.

Yet, much remains unknown about how insular functions promote nicotine use. We review current models of brain networks in smoking and propose an extension to those models that emphasizes the role of the insula in craving. During acute withdrawal, the insula provides the sensation of craving to the cerebrum and is thought to negotiate craving sensations with cognitive control to guide behavior - either to smoke or abstain. Recent studies have shown that insula processing is saturable, such that different insular functions compete for limited resources. We propose that this saturability explains how craving during withdrawal can overload insular processing to the exclusion of other functions, such as saliency and network homeostasis. A novel signal flow model illustrates how limited insular capacity leads to breakdown of normal function. Finally, we discuss suitability of insula as a neuromodulation target to promote cessation. Given the limited efficacy of standard-of-care treatments for nicotine use disorder, insular neuromodulation offers an innovative, potentially therapeutic target for improving smoking cessation.",2021/12/8,17cc7acb2edd4ce9,2021/12/28,1,

To delineate both theories from each other, we tested if temporal discounting, choice inconsistency, and related brain activity in treatment-seeking smokers (1) are higher compared to non-smokers, (2) decrease after smoking cessation, and (3) predict relapse. Methods At T1, 44 dependent smokers, 29 non-smokers, and 30 occasional smokers underwent fMRI while performing an intertemporal choice task. Smokers were measured before and 21 days after cessation if abstinent from nicotine. In total, 27 smokers, 28 non-smokers, and 29 occasional smokers were scanned again at T2. Discounting rate k and inconsistency var(k) were estimated with Bayesian analysis. Results First, k and var(k) in smokers in treatment were not higher than in non-smokers or occasional smokers. Second, neither k nor var(k) changed after smoking cessation. Third, k did not predict relapse, but high var(k) was associated with relapse during treatment and over 6 months. Brain activity in valuation and decision networks did not significantly differ between groups and conditions. Conclusion Our data from treatment-seeking smokers do not support the pharmacological hypothesis of pronounced reversible changes in discounting behavior and brain activity, possibly due to limited power.

There is a promising initial behavioral evidence supporting this theory; however, the neural bases of reactivity to U-threat in individuals with AUD have not been examined. The extent to which biomarkers of U-threat reactivity map onto drinking behaviors and coping motives for alcohol use is also unknown. The current study therefore examined group differences in behavioral and neural reactivity to U-threat in adults with and without AUD. The study also tested whether behavior and brain responses to U-threat correlate with problematic drinking and coping motivated drinking. Volunteers (n = 65) with and without a history of AUD (38 AUD, 27 controls) were included and completed a well-validated threat-of-shock task to probe responses to U-threat and predictable threat (P-threat) while startle eyeblink potentiation was collected. Individuals also completed a newly designed, analogous version of the task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results indicated that individuals with AUD displayed greater startle magnitude during U-threat, but not P-threat, and greater right insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during both forms of threat compared with controls. Startle magnitude and insula activation during U-threat positively correlated with self-reported problem drinking and coping motives for alcohol use. Findings demonstrate that individuals with AUD display exaggerated sensitivity to U-threat at the behavioral and neural level and that these multimethod biomarkers tap into negative reinforcement processes of alcohol abuse.",2021/12/8,17cc7acbf56cc79f,2021/12/28,1,

Compromised insular integrity is implicated in alcohol and drug use disorders. Alcohol-associated insular dysfunction may arise through aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission associated with selective neuronal death and atrophy. Objective In a sample of alcohol users, we combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with voxel and surface-based morphometry (VBM, SBM) to test the hypothesis that the neurochemical and structural properties of the insula relate to alcohol use. Methods Twenty-three healthy individuals were characterized by measures of alcohol use and subjective craving. Right mid-insula glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and total N-acetylaspartate/N-acetyl-aspartylglutamate (TNAA) concentrations were measured using MRS. Right insular structure was quantified using VBM and SBM parameters. We tested for predictive associations between these neuroimaging and behavioral/psychometric measures using Bayesian statistics. Results Reduced insular Glx concentration was associated with increased alcohol compulsions and, to a lesser extent, with greater alcohol use severity. Anecdotal evidence for a negative relationship between alcohol use severity and levels of insular gyrification was also observed. Conclusions This study is, to date, the first characterization of the neurochemical and morphological integrity of insular cortex in alcohol users. Our data seem to reveal a negative relationship between alcohol use and the neurochemical and structural integrity of the insula, a critical substrate for motivational behavior. These neurobiological characteristics might contribute to loss of control toward compulsive drinking with prolonged and excessive alcohol use.",2021/12/8,17cc7acbeb7a9469,2021/12/28,1,

Although the use of both heroin and methamphetamine leads to use disorders through dysfunction of the dopamine pathway, the incidence of psychiatric disorder caused by methamphetamine abuse is higher than the incidence of psychiatric disorder caused by heroin abuse. The difference in resting-state function between heroin use disorder (HUD) and methamphetamine use disorder (MAUD) and the relationship between resting-state function and psychiatric disorder related to MAUD are unknown. Methods In the present study, 21 male individuals with MAUD, 21 demographically matched individuals with HUD, and 21 normal controls (NC) were recruited. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) during resting-state brain function was measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Psychiatric status was evaluated by the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL90). Results Individuals with MAUD had increased SCL90 scores compared to those of the NC for anxiety, paranoia, and additional items, and the hostility score was significantly increased compared to that of individuals with HUD. There is no significant difference between HUD and NC individuals. Individuals with MAUD had increased ALFF compared to those of the NC for thalamus, right postcentral, and right inferior temporal gyri, but a decreased ALFF in the cerebellum. Individuals with HUD had significantly increased ALFF compared to those of the NC for left middle frontal gyrus but a decreased ALFF in the left postcentral gyrus. Individuals with MAUD had significantly increased ALFF compared to those of the HUD for thalamus, the right inferior temporal, and bilateral postcentral gyri, and the ALFF of cerebellum and left middle frontal was significantly increased. Conclusions Methamphetamine can induce more serious psychiatric disorders than heroin. The resting-state function involved in mood adjustment, the auditory, and memory-related brain regions may affect psychotic symptoms related to MAUD.",2021/12/8,17cc7acc059487f8,2021/12/28,1,

There is considerable previous work demonstrating neural reactivity to alcohol cues in AUD. Because alcohol consumption and sexual behavior are both rewarding and tend to co-occur, sexual cues may produce similar neural reactivity in women with AUD, possibly indicating a shared mechanism underlying reactivity to both types of cues. Alternatively, reactivity to alcohol versus sexual cues may be distinct, suggesting domain-specific mechanisms. Objectives We investigated whether the decision vulnerabilities in AUD women regarding sexual activity were related to differences in brain activation compared to control women. Methods Women with (n = 15) and without (n = 16) AUD completed a hypothetical decision-making task during fMRI that presented low- or high-risk scenarios involving visual sexual, appetitive, and neutral cues. Results Results showed that sexual cues were more often endorsed by women with AUD compared to controls and elicited differential brain activation patterns in frontal, visual, and reward regions. During high-risk decisions, women with AUD failed to downregulate activation, causing hyperactivation compared to controls. Conclusions Visual sexual cues produced reactivity like that previously demonstrated for alcohol cues, suggesting a shared or domain-general mechanism for alcohol and sexual cue reactivity in women with AUD. Riskier sexual decisions in women with AUD may be a consequence of repeatedly pairing alcohol use and sexual activity, a characteristic behavior of this population.",2021/12/8,17cc7acc3f0e7f60,2021/12/28,1,

We hypothesized reduced volume of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), reduced structural connectivity of the segment of the supero-lateral medial forebrain bundle connecting the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with the NAcc (OFC-NAcc), and reduced resting-state OFC-NAcc functional connectivity (FC). Furthermore, we hypothesized that craving is related to an increase of OFC-NAcc FC. Thirty-nine recently abstinent patients with AUD and 18 healthy controls (HC) underwent structural (T1w-MP2RAGE, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)) and functional (resting-state fMRI) MRI-scans. Gray matter volume of the NAcc, white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy (FA)) and macrostructure (tract length) of the OFC-NAcc connection and OFC-NAcc FC were compared between AUD and HC using a mixed model MANCOVA controlling for age and gender. Craving was assessed using the thoughts subscale of the obsessive-compulsive drinking scale (OCDS) scale and was correlated with OFC-NAcc FC. There was a significant main effect of group. Results were driven by a volume reduction of bilateral NAcc, reduced FA in the left hemisphere, and reduced tract length of bilateral OFC-NAcc connections in AUD patients. OFC-NAcc FC did not differ between groups. Craving was associated with increased bilateral OFC-NAcc FC. In conclusion, reduced volume of the NAcc and reduced FA and tract length of the OFC-NAcc network suggest structural alterations of the reward network in AUD. Increased OFC-NAcc FC is associated with craving in AUD, and may contribute to situational alcohol-seeking behavior in AUD.",2021/12/8,17cc7acc24e934c1,2021/12/28,1,

Here we used multimodal neuroimaging methods to ask whether modulating reward-related signaling in the ACC can reverse the atypical valuation of nondrug and drug rewards in abstinent smokers. METHODS: We first recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 20 moderately dependent cigarette smokers (mean age 5 25 years; no history of neuropsychiatric disorders), following an overnight period of abstinence, to identify regions of the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex associated with the anticipation of drug-related rewards (cigarette puff). Next, we recorded the reward positivity-an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the ACC to rewards-while participants engaged in two feedback tasks to gain either monetary or cigarette rewards. Lastly, guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging data, a robotic arm positioned a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation coil over a subject-specific dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex target, and 50 repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses were delivered at 10 Hz (excitatory stimulation) immediately before each block of 10 trials of the money condition and at 1 Hz (inhibitory stimulation) before each block of 10 trials of the cigarette condition. RESULTS: Our findings show that abstained smokers exhibited a heightened reward positivity to cigarette rewards relative to monetary rewards, and by applying excitatory or inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to a subject-specific frontal-cingulate reward pathway, this pattern of results was reversed. CONCLUSIONS: By modulating how the brain links value to drug and nondrug rewards, novel brain-based treatments may finally be on the horizon.",2021/12/8,17cc7acc581df84b,2021/12/28,1,

Neuroimaging studies have shown alcohol-related aberrations in occipital cortices that appear to be associated with these neuropsychological deficits in visual-spatial processing, however the neural dynamics underlying this altered processing remains unknown. Methods: Twenty-three adults with high scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (male: > 5, female: > 4) were compared to 30 demographically-matched controls with low Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption scores (<= 2). All participants completed a visual-spatial processing task while undergoing high-density magnetoencephalography. Time-frequency windows of interest were determined using a data-driven method, and spectrally-specific neural activity was imaged using a beamforming approach. Permutation testing of peak voxel time series was then used to statistically compare across groups. Results: Participants with heavy alcohol use responded slower on the task and their performance was more variable. The magnetoencephalography data indicated strong theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (10-16 Hz), and gamma (62-72 Hz) responses in posterior brain regions across both groups. Following voxel time-series extraction, significant group differences were found in the left and right visual association cortices from about 375-550 ms post-stimulus, such that adults with heavy alcohol use had blunted alpha responses compared to controls.

Resting state functional connectivity has shown great potential in identifying these alterations. However, current studies focus on specific seeds and leave out many brain regions where effects might exist. The present study uses a data driven technique for brain segmentation covering the whole brain. Functional magnetic-resonance-imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 188 subjects: 51 non-substance consumption controls (CTR), 36 smoking-and-drinking subjects (SAD), 28 drinkers (DRN), and 73 smokers (SMK). Data were processed using group independent component analysis to derive resting state networks (RSN). The resting state functional network connectivity (rsFNC) was then calculated through correlation between time courses. One-way ANOVA tests were used to detect rsFNC differences among the four groups. A total of 50 ANOVA tests were significant after multi-comparison correction. Results delineate a general pattern of hypo-connectivity in the substance consumers. Precuneus, postcentral gyrus, insula and visual cortex were the main brain areas with rsFNC reduction suggesting reduced interoceptive awareness in drinkers. In addition, connectivity reduction between postcentral and one RSN covering right fusiform and lingual gyri showed significant association with severity of hazardous drinking. In smokers, connectivity changes agreed with the idea of a shift towards endogenous information processing, represented by the DMN. Hypo-connectivity between thalamus and putamen was observed in smokers. In contrast, the angular gyrus showed hyper-connectivity with the precuneus linked to smoking and significantly correlated with nicotine dependence severity. In spite of the presence of common effects, our results suggest that particular effects of alcohol and nicotine can be separated and identified.

We demonstrate that problem drinking is highest in the context of stress and in those with one of two distinct neural phenotypes: (1) a combination of relatively low reward -related activity of the ventral striatum (VS) and high threat -related reactivity of the amygdala; or (2) a combination of relatively high VS activity and low amygdala reactivity. In addition, we demonstrate that the relationship between stress and problem alcohol use is mediated by impulsivity, as reflected in monetary delay discounting rates, for those with high VS low amygdala reactivity, and by anxious/depressive symptomatology for those with the opposite neural risk phenotype. Across both neural phenotypes, we found that greater divergence between VS and amygdala reactivity predicted greater risk for problem drinking. Finally, for those individuals with the low VS high amygdala risk phenotype we found that stress not only predicted the presence of AUD diagnosis at the time of neuroimaging but also subsequent problem drinking reported 3 months following study completion.

We examined the clinical characters and the relationships between theory of mind (ToM) and executive functions in three groups: heroin plus nicotine-dependent (HND) patients who had remained heroin abstinent (>= 3 months), nicotine-dependent (ND) subjects, and healthy controls (C). The domains included emotion recognition, inhibition, shifting, updating, access, and processing speed. Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), ToM task-induced functional connectivity, and brain networks were then explored among 21 matched subjects using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. HND enhanced the severities of anxiety, depression, and hyperactivity. Inhibition domain was impaired in both HND and ND. No impairment in domains of emotion recognition, access, and update was observed.

Recent findings reveal that internal and external processing occurs in the ventral anterior insula (vAI) and dorsal anterior insula (dAI), respectively. Whether vAI/dAI network connectivity differentially reflects internally generated craving and externally triggered smoking cue reactivity was tested. METHODS: Thirty-six male and female nicotine-dependent individuals smoked 1 hour before functional magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline craving was measured, followed by resting-state and smoking cue reactivity scans and then another assessment of craving. Craving and cue reactivity interactions were measured by focusing on specific nodes of the salience network: the vAI/dAI and anterior cingulate cortex. RESULTS: Resting-state vAI/dAI networks overlapped with the prototypical salience network, yet they possessed distinct patterns, linking the vAI with nodes of the internally focused default mode network and the dAI with nodes of the external, goal-related frontoparietal network. Internally generated baseline craving was associated with enhanced vAI connectivity, whereas rostral anterior cingulate cortex reactivity to external smoking cues was associated with greater dAI connectivity. We also found that cue reactivity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was associated with a rise in subjective cue-induced craving, whereas baseline subjective craving did not influence brain cue reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that brain reactivity to smoking cues is associated with a subsequent increase in craving. In addition, separate insula networks have a role in an individual's vulnerability to internally related craving and externally triggered cue reactivity, which could guide the development of new, neurobiologically targeted therapies.",NA,NA,NA,0,

During adolescence, incentives improve performance on response inhibition tasks and increase recruitment of cortical control areas (Geier et al., 2010) associated with SUD (Chung et al., 2011). However, it is unknown whether incentives moderate the relationship between response inhibition and trait-level psychopathology and personality features of substance use risk. We examined these associations in the current project using a rewarded antisaccade (AS) task (Geier et al., 2010) in youth at risk for substance use. Participants were 116 adolescents and young adults (ages 12-21) from the University of Pittsburgh site of the National Consortium on Adolescent Neurodevelopment and Alcohol [NCANDA] study, with neuroimaging data collected at baseline and 1 year follow up visits. Building upon previous work using this task in normative developmental samples (Geier et al., 2010) and adolescents with SUD (Chung et al., 2011), we examined both trial-wise BOLD responses and those associated with individual task-epochs (cue presentation, response preparation, and response) and associated them with multiple substance use risk factors (externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, family history of substance use, and trait impulsivity). Results showed that externalizing psychopathology and high levels of trait impulsivity (positive urgency, SUPPS-P) were associated with general decreases in antisaccade performance. Accompanying this main effect of poor performance, positive urgency was associated with reduced recruitment of the frontal eye fields (FEF) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in both a priori regions of interest and at the voxelwise level. Consistent with previous work, monetary incentive improved antisaccade behavioral performance and was associated with increased activation in the striatum and cortical control areas. However, incentives did not moderate the association between response inhibition behavioral performance and any trait-level psychopathology and personality factor of substance use risk. Reward interactions were observed for BOLD responses at the task-epoch level, however, they were inconsistent across substance use risk types. The results from this study may suggest poor response inhibition and heightened reward sensitivity are not overlapping neurocognitive features of substance use risk. Alternatively, more subtle, common longitudinal processes might jointly explain reward sensitivity and response inhibition deficits in substance use risk.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Specifically, the AUD group manifested hyperconnectivity across the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and the prefrontal cortex as well as between the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex and the left inferior parietal lobule, while showing hypoconnectivity in long-range anterior-posterior and interhemispheric long-range connections. Individuals with AUD also showed poorer memory performance and increased impulsivity compared to CTL individuals. Furthermore, there were significant associations among FC, impulsivity, neuropsychological performance, and AUD status.

Behavioral strategies to regulate craving may facilitate smoking cessation but remain underexplored. We adapted an emotion-regulation strategy, using proximal/distal self-positioning, to the context of cigarette craving to examine craving regulation in 42, daily smokers (18-25 years old). After overnight abstinence from smoking, before and after smoking their first cigarette of the day, participants viewed videos of natural scenes presenting young adults who were either smoking cigarettes (smoke) or not (non-smoke). Before each video, participants were instructed to imagine themselves either immersed in the scene (close) or distanced from it (far). They rated their craving after each video. Task-based fMRI data are presented for a subsample of participants (N = 21). We found main effects of smoking, instruction, and video type on craving-lower ratings after smoking than before, following the far vs. close instructions, and when viewing non-smoke vs. smoke videos. Before smoking, smoke vs. non-smoke videos elicited activation in, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, lateral parietal cortex, mid-occipital cortex, ventral striatum, dorsal caudate, and midbrain. Smoking reduced activation in anterior cingulate, left inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral temporal poles. Activation was reduced in the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex after the far vs. the close instruction, suggesting less engagement with the stimuli during distancing. The results indicate that proximal/distal regulation strategies impact cue-elicited craving, potentially via downregulation of the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, and that smoking during abstinence may increase cognitive control capacity during craving regulation.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Here we examine the effects of nicotine dependence (trait; smokers (n = 24) vs. non-smoking controls; n = 20) and acute nicotinic stimulation (state; administration of nicotine and varenicline, two FDA-approved smoking cessation aids, during abstinence), on two well-established tests of inhibitory control, the Go-Nogo task and the Flanker task, during fMRI scanning. We compared performance and neural responses between these four pharmacological manipulations in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. As expected, performance in both tasks was modulated by nicotine dependence, abstinence, and pharmacological manipulation. However, effects were driven entirely by conditions that required less inhibitory control. When demand for inhibitory control was high, abstinent smokers showed no deficits. By contrast, acutely abstinent smokers showed performance deficits in easier conditions and missed more trials. Go-Nogo fMRI results showed decreased inhibition-related neural activity in right anterior insula and right putamen in smokers and decreased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity on nicotine across groups. No effects were found on inhibition-related activity during the Flanker task or on error-related activity in either task. Given robust nicotinic effects on physiology and behavioral deficits in attention, we are confident that pharmacological manipulations were effective. Thus findings fit a recent proposal that abstinent smokers show decreased ability to divert cognitive resources at low or intermediate cognitive demand, while performance at high cognitive demand remains relatively unaffected, suggesting a primary attentional deficit during acute abstinence.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Most studies examining the neurobiology of AUD treat individuals with this disorder as a homogeneous group; however, the theories of the neurocircuitry of AUD call for a quantitative and dimensional approach. Previous imaging studies find differences in brain structure, function, and resting-state connectivity in AUD, but few use a multimodal approach to understand the association between severity of alcohol use and the brain differences. Methods: Adults (ages 22-60) with problem drinking patterns (n = 59) completed a behavioral and neuroimaging protocol at the National Institutes of Health. Alcohol severity was quantified with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). In a 3 T MRI scanner, participants underwent a structural MRI as well as restingstate, monetary incentive delay, and face matching fMRI scans. Machine learning was applied and trained using the neural data from MRI scanning. The model was tested for generalizability in a validation sample (n = 24). Results: The resting state-connectivity features model best predicted AUD severity in the naive sample, compared to task fMRI, structural MRI, combined MRI features, or demographic features. Network connectivity features between salience network, default mode network, executive control network, and sensory networks explained 33% of the variance associated with AUDIT in this model. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the neural effects of AUD vary according to severity.

Unfortunately, smokers are often exposed to cigarette-related salient cues, which may violate homeostasis, override self-control, and lead to relapse. To understand the mechanisms underlying these associations, we investigate the cognitive and neural processes of inhibitory control (including proactive and reactive inhibition) of smoking cues in abstinent smokers. Twenty-six smokers completed cue-reactivity and stop signal tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, on two separate sessions, 2-3 weeks apart one involved a neutral cue reactivity task, and the other a smoking cue reactivity task. Findings pointed to no significant subjective craving changes, or behavioral influences of smoking cues on proactive and reactive inhibition. However, abstinent smokers exhibited hyperactive brain reactivity in response to smoking versus neutral stimuli, in regions including the insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and putamen. They also had hypoactive bilateral rostral ACC (rACC) and hyperactive right pre-supplementary motor area during reactive inhibition in smoking versus neutral conditions. Support vector regression analysis showed that activation of these regions predicted and correlated with reactive inhibition index (i.e., SSRT), alluding to the possibility of their involvement in the reactive inhibition. Subjective craving scores were predicted by and correlated with activation of bilateral dorsal and rostral ACC, supporting the ideas of their possible involvement in subjective craving. These findings suggest that smoking cues evoke hyperactive brain reactivity; this may interfere with normal performance monitoring and rapid reactive inhibition.

Relatively little research has focused on the affective or emotional risk components of this high-risk phenotype, including the relevant neurobiology. Methods: Non-substance abusing youth (N=19; mean age = 12.2) with externalizing psychopathology and paternal history of a substance use disorder and demographically matched healthy comparisons (N=18; mean age = 11.9) were tested on a facial emotion matching task during functional MRI. This task involved matching faces by emotions (angry, anxious) or matching shape orientation. Results: High-risk youth exhibited increased medial prefrontal, precuneus and occipital cortex activation compared to the healthy comparison group during the face matching condition, relative to the control shape condition. The occipital activation correlated positively with parent-rated emotion regulation impairments in the high-risk group. Conclusions: These findings suggest a preexisting abnormality in cortical activation in response to facial emotion matching in youth at high risk for the development of problem drug or alcohol use.

Novel insights into this issue might come from the analysis of resting-state brain activity, representing a baseline level of intrinsic connectivity within and between the networks underlying cognitive performance. We thus addressed the neural bases of cognitive impairment(s) in 22 AUD patients, compared with 18 healthy controls, by coupling resting-state fMRI with an in-depth neuropsychological assessment of the main cognitive domains. We assessed a relationship between AUD patients' cognitive impairment and two complementary facets of intrinsic brain functioning, i.e., intensity of activation and functional network connectivity, related to the strength of connectivity within and between resting-state networks, respectively. Alcoholic patients' decreased cognitive performance involved specifically an executive domain associated with attentional and working-memory tasks. This impairment reflected an abnormal relationship, in patients versus controls, between cognitive performance and the intensity of intrinsic activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal and striatal nodes of the executive control network. Functional connectivity between the same structures was positively correlated with executive performance in the whole sample, but significantly reduced in patients. The present data suggest that AUD patients' executive impairment reflects dysfunctional connectivity between the cortical and subcortical nodes of the networks underlying cognitive control on goal-directed behavior.

A significant decrease of loss aversion in patients, unrelated to their impaired executive/working-memory performance, reflected the reduction of posterior fronto-medial grey matter density and right frontopolar cortical thickness. Rather than their executive deficits, patients' reduced loss aversion reflects the structural damage of the posterior fronto-medial cortex previously associated with solving conflicts at the response level, where earlier functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown a 'neural loss aversion' pattern of steeper deactivation for losses than activation for gains, and of the frontopolar cortex in charge of managing competing goals. These findings highlight possible directions for addressing AUD patients' high relapse rate, for example, cognitive-behavioural rehabilitative interventions enhancing the awareness of the adverse outcomes of addiction or neurostimulation protocols targeting the regions processing their salience.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Delay discounting was compared in people with no mental health problems, AD, BD and AD plus BD. Associations of delay discounting with self-reported impulsivity and reward sensitivity were also assessed. Design The study was a two-by-two factorial comparative observational design. Setting Data were collected at baseline diagnostic visits as part of a neuroimaging study at a medical university in South Carolina, USA. Participants Twenty-two BD + AD, 33 BD, 28 AD and 27 people without mental health problems participated. Measurements Diagnostic and clinician-rated symptom measures, self-report questionnaires and a computerized delay discounting task were administered. Two-by-two general linear univariate models were tested to examine between-group differences on discounting rates, and bivariate correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine associations between discounting rates and self-reported reward sensitivity and impulsivity. Findings There was a significant main effect of AD (P = 0.006, eta(2) = 0.068). The main effect of BD and the BD x AD interaction terms were non-significant (P >= 0.293, eta(2) <= 0.010). Reward sensitivity and impulsivity were not significantly associated with discounting rates after adjustment for the other (P >= 0.089). Conclusions People with alcohol dependence appear to have higher delay discounting, while previously found associations between bipolar disorder and delay discounting may be secondary to alcohol use disorder.",NA,NA,NA,0,

The current study aimed to test the strength of association between (1) alcohol use and GM volume; (2) alcohol use and white matter (WM) integrity; (3) cannabis use and GM volume; and (4) cannabis use and WM integrity among adults and adolescents. Design and Setting General linear models within large pooled cross-sectional samples of adolescents and adults who had participated in studies collecting substance use and neuroimaging data in the southwestern United States. Participants The current analysis included adults aged 18-55 years (n=853) and adolescents aged 14-18 years (n=439) with a range of alcohol and cannabis use. Measurements The dependent variable was GM volume or WM integrity, with key predictors of alcohol use [Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score] and cannabis use (past 30-day use). Findings Alcohol use showed large clusters of negative associations (eta(2)(p)=0.028-0.145, P<0.001) with GM volume among adults and to a lesser extent (one cluster; eta(2)(p)=0.070, P<0.05) among adolescents.

The anterior insula is functionally connected to the anterior cingulate cortex, together comprising the major nodes of the salience network, which serves to signal salient events, including negative consequences. Clinical studies have found structural and functional alterations in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortices of alcohol dependent individuals. No studies have yet investigated the association between morphometric abnormalities in salience network regions and the phenotype of high levels of impulsivity and compulsivity seen in alcohol dependent individuals. Methods: In the current study, we compared self-report impulsivity, decisional impulsivity, self-report compulsivity, and structural neuroimaging measures in a sample of alcohol dependent individuals (n = 60) and a comparison group of healthy controls (n - 49). Front the structural magnetic resonance images, we calculated volume and cortical thickness for 6 regions of interest: left and right anterior insula, posterior insula, and anterior cingulate. Results: We found that alcohol dependent individuals had smaller anterior insula and anterior cingulate volumes, as well as thinner anterior insula cortices. There were no group differences in posterior insula morphometry. Anterior insula and anterior cingulate structural measures were negatively associated with self-report impulsivity, decisional impulsivity, and compulsivity measures. Conclusions: Our results suggest that addiction endophenotypes are associated with salience network morphometry in alcohol addiction.

Although the majority of smokers report making a quit attempt in the past year, smoking cessation rates remain modest. Thus, developing accurate, data-driven methods that can classify and characterize the neural features of nicotine use disorder (NUD) would be a powerful clinical tool that could aid in optimizing treatment development and guide treatment modifications. This investigation applied support vector machine-based classification to resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) data from individuals diagnosed with NUD (n = 108; 63 male) and matched nonsmoking controls (n = 108; 63 male) and multi-dimensional scaling to visualize the heterogeneity of NUD in individual smokers based on rsFC measures. Machine-based learning models identified five resting-state networks that played a role in distinguishing smokers from controls: the posterior and anterior default mode networks, the sensorimotor network, the salience network and the right executive control network. The classification method constructed classifiers with an average correct classification rate of 88.1 percent and an average area under the curve of 0.93. Compared with controls, individuals with NUD had weaker functional connectivity measures within these networks (P < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Further, multi-dimensional scaling visualization demonstrated that controls were similar to each other whereas individuals with NUD had less similarity to controls and to other individuals with NUD. Our findings build upon previous literature demonstrating that machine learning-based approaches to classifying rsFC data offer a valuable technique to understanding network-level differences in nicotine-related neurobiology and extend previous findings by improving classification accuracy and demonstrating the heterogeneity in resting-state networks of individuals with NUD.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Nalmefene, as an opioid receptor modulator, could pharmacologically support the reduction of drinking by reducing the (anticipated) rewarding effects of alcohol and expanding the range of treatment options. It has been hypothesized that nalmefene acts via an indirect modulation of the mesolimbic reward system. So far, only a few imaging findings on the neuronal response to nalmefene are available. Objectives We tested the effect of a single dose of 18 mg nalmefene on neuronal cue-reactivity in the ventral and dorsal striatum and subjective craving. Methods Eighteen non-treatment-seeking participants with alcohol use disorder (67% male, M = 50.3 +/- 13.9 years) with a current high-risk drinking level (M = 76.9 +/- 52 g of pure alcohol per day) were investigated using a cue-reactivity task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study/design. In addition, self-reported craving was assessed before and after exposure to alcohol cues. Results An a priori defined region of interest (ROI) analysis of fMRI data from 15 participants revealed that nalmefene reduced alcohol cue-reactivity in the ventral, but not the dorsal striatum. Additionally, the subjective craving was significantly reduced after the cue-reactivity task under nalmefene compared to placebo. Conclusion In the present study, reduced craving and cue-reactivity to alcohol stimuli in the ventral striatum by nalmefene indicates a potential anti-craving effect of this drug via attenuation of neural alcohol cue-reactivity.",NA,NA,NA,0,

A hallmark of cognitive control is the ability to anticipate changes and adjust behavior accordingly. Here, we employed a Bayesian model to describe trial-by-trial anticipation of the stop signal and modeled fMRI signals of conflict anticipation in a stop signal task. Our goal is to characterize the neural correlates of conflict anticipation and its relationship to response inhibition and alcohol consumption in AD. Methods: Twenty-four AD and 70 age and gender matched healthy control individuals (HC) participated in the study. fMRI data were pre-processed and modeled with SPM8. We modeled fMRI signals at trial onset with individual events parametrically modulated by estimated probability of the stop signal, p(Stop), and compared regional responses to conflict anticipation between AD and HC. To address the link to response inhibition, we regressed whole-brain responses to conflict anticipation against the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). Results: Compared to HC (54/70), fewer AD (11/24) showed a significant sequential effect -a correlation between p(Stop) and RT during go trials-and themagnitude of sequential effect is diminished, suggesting a deficit in proactive control. Parametric analyses showed decreased learning rate and over-estimated prior mean of the stop signal in AD. In fMRI, both HC and AD responded to p(Stop) in bilateral inferior parietal cortex and anterior pre-supplementary motor area, although the magnitude of response increased in AD. In contrast, HC but not AD showed deactivation of the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC). Furthermore, deactivation of the pgACC to increasing p(Stop) is positively correlated with the SSRT in HC but not AD. Recent alcohol consumption is correlated with increased activation of the thalamus and cerebellum in AD during conflict anticipation. Conclusions: The current results highlight altered proactive control that may serve as an additional behavioral and neural marker of alcohol dependence. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Animal research suggests an underlying imbalance between goal-directed and habitual action control with chronic drug use. However, this imbalance, and its associated neurophysiological mechanisms, has not yet been experimentally investigated in human drug abusers. The aim of the present study therefore was to assess the balance between goal-directed and habit-based learning and its neural correlates in abstinent alcohol-dependent (AD) patients. A total of 31 AD patients and 19 age, gender and education matched healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during completion of an instrumental learning task designed to study the balance between goal-directed and habit learning. Task performance and task-related blood oxygen level-dependent activations in the brain were compared between AD patients and healthy matched controls. Findings were additionally associated with duration and severity of alcohol dependence. The results of this study provide evidence for an overreliance on stimulus-response habit learning in AD compared with HC, which was accompanied by decreased engagement of brain areas implicated in goal-directed action (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior putamen) and increased recruitment of brain areas implicated in habit learning (posterior putamen) in AD patients. In conclusion, this is the first human study to provide experimental evidence for a disturbed balance between goal-directed and habitual control by use of an instrumental learning task, and to directly implicate cortical dysfunction to overreliance on inflexible habits in AD patients.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Methods: We conducted a prospective resting-state functional MRI study comparing the functional connectivity strength among healthy controls and heroin-dependent men who had either relapsed or were in early remission. Men were considered to be either relapsed or in early remission based on urine drug screens during a 3-month follow-up period. We also examined how the coupling of large-scale networks correlated with relapse behaviour among heroin-dependent men. Results: We included 20 controls and 50 heroin-dependent men (26 relapsed and 24 early remission) in our analyses. The relapsed men showed greater connectivity than the early remission and control groups between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (key node of the SN) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (included in the DMN). The relapsed men and controls showed lower connectivity than the early remission group between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (key node of the left ECN) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. The percentage of positive urine drug screens positively correlated with the coupling between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, but negatively correlated with the coupling between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Limitations: We examined deficits in only 3 core networks leading to relapse behaviour. Other networks may also contribute to relapse.

Although the cerebellum plays an increasingly implicated role in ND, the exact cerebellar alterations in ND remain unclear. Identifying the localization of these cerebellar abnormalities in ND may help to further understand the role of the cerebellum in ND. Thus, we investigated the structural and functional alterations in the cerebellum in a large sample of smokers using the spatially unbiased infratentorial template (SUIT). Methods: High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired from 85 smokers and 41 nonsmokers. We applied voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the SUIT cerebellar atlas to compare the cerebellar gray matter (GM) volume between smokers and nonsmokers. Using resting-state functional MRI data, we also performed seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis to examine the functional correlates of the GM volume changes. Results: Both VBM and lobular analyses revealed smaller GM volume in the bilateral Crus I in smokers. The GM volume of the left Crus I was inversely correlated with the severity of nicotine dependence as assessed by Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (r = -.268, p = .013). We also found reduced FC between the bilateral Crus I and brain regions involved in the default mode network and motor system, as well as the frontal and temporal cortex in smokers. Conclusions: Our results indicate that decreased cerebellar GM volume and corticocerebellar FC are associated with ND, and these may underlie the core ND phenotypes, including automatized smoking behavior, cognitive, and emotional deficits.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Individuals with alcohol dependence show abnormalities in gambling and other risk-taking tasks.

In a prior study, alcohol-dependent participants differed from controls in brain activation during decision-making on the BART, but the relationship between risk/reward magnitude and brain activation was not studied, nor were participants compared to controls. Here we compared the degree to which risk and magnitude of reward influenced brain activation in alcohol-dependent participants vs. controls during decision-making on the BART. Methods: Thirty-two participants (16 alcohol-dependent, 16 control; 5 females/group) performed the BART during fMRI. A parametric analysis tested for a relationship between risk/reward magnitude and activation in rDLPFC and bilateral striatum regions of interest when participants chose to take risk or to cash out. An exploratory whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of mean activation during pumping, cash-out, and explosion events was also conducted. Results: Compared with controls, alcohol-dependent participants displayed less modulation of activation in the rDLPFC when taking risk. Exploratory analyses found that alcohol-dependent participants showed less activation than controls during explosions in a cluster including the insula.

Cross-sectional resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) studies in humans identified a circuit between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the ventral striatum that negatively correlated with increased nicotine dependence severity but was unaffected by acute nicotine administration, suggesting a trait marker of addiction. However, whether this trait circuit dysregulation is predispositional to or resultant from nicotine dependence is unclear. Using a rat model of nicotine dependence with longitudinal fMRI measurements, we assessed the relationship between ACC-striatal rsFC and nicotine dependence severity. Data-driven modularity-based parcellation of the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) combined with seed-based connectivity analysis with the striatum recapitulated the cingulate-striatum relationship observed in humans. Furthermore, the relationship between cingulate-striatal brain circuits and nicotine dependence severity as indexed by the intensity of precipitated withdrawal, was fully statistically moderated by a predispositional insular-frontal cortical functional circuit. These data suggest that the identified trans-species ACC-striatal circuit relationship with nicotine dependence severity is dysregulated following chronic nicotine administration-induced dependence and may be biased by individual differences in predispositional insula-based striatal-frontal circuits, highlighting the circuit's potential as a biomarker of dependence severity.",NA,NA,NA,0,

However, little is known whether these interoceptive alterations extend to opioid use disorder (OUD). This exploratory study used the same experimental probe during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that SUD and OUD exhibit interoceptive discrepancies characterized by subjective ratings and activation within the insula. Recently, abstinent individuals diagnosed with current SUD (n = 40) or current OUD (n = 20) were compared with healthy individuals (CTL; n = 30) on brain and self-report responses during an interoceptive attention task known to elicit insula activation. Participants selectively attended to interoceptive (heartbeat and stomach) and exteroceptive signals during blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI recording. Groups and conditions were compared on (a) activation within probabilistic cytoarchitectonic segmentations of the insula and (b) self-reported stimulus intensity. First, SUD showed amplified ratings of heart-related sensations but attenuation of dorsal dysgranular insula activity relative to CTL. Amplified ratings were linked to drug use recency, while attenuation was normalized with greater past-year stimulant use. Second, SUD and OUD showed attenuation of dorsal dysgranular insula activity during attention to stomach sensations relative to CTL. Taken together, these results are consistent with altered neural processing of interoceptive signals in drug addiction, particularly as a function of SUD. Future studies will need to determine whether interoceptive metrics help to explain substance use disorder pathophysiology and are useful for predicting outcomes.",NA,NA,NA,0,
OPI,Effects of extended-release naltrexone on the brain response to drug-related stimuli in patients with opioid use disorder,J. Psychiatry Neurosci.,2018,"Shi, Zhenhao; Wang, An-Li; Jagannathan, Kanchana; Fairchild, Victoria P.; O'Brien, Charles P.; Childress, Anna Rose; Langleben, Daniel D.","Langleben, DD (corresponding author), Ctr Studies Addict, 3535 Market St,Suite 500, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",Langleben,someemail@address.com,"Background: Heightened response to drug-related cues is a hallmark of addiction. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). In these patients, XR-NTX has been shown to reduce brain responses to opioid-related visual stimuli. To assess the biomarker potential of this phenomenon, it is necessary to determine whether this effect is limited to opioid-related stimuli and whether it is associated with key OUD symptoms. Methods: Using functional MRI (fMRI), we measured the brain responses to opioid-related and control (i.e., sexual and aversive) images in detoxified patients with OUD before, during and after XR-NTX treatment. Craving and withdrawal severity were evaluated using clinician- and self-administered instruments during each session. Results: We included 24 patients with OUD in our analysis. During XR-NTX treatment, we found reduced responses to opioid-related stimuli in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). The reduction in mOFC response was specific to the opioid-related stimuli. The reduced NAcc and mOFC opioid cue reactivity was correlated with reduction in clinician-assessed and self-reported withdrawal symptoms, respectively. Limitations: The study was not placebo-controlled owing to ethical, safety and feasibility concerns. Conclusion: Extended-release naltrexone reduces the NAcc and mOFC cue reactivity in patients with OUD. This effect is specific to opioid-related stimuli in the mOFC only. The reduction in neural response to opioid-related stimuli is more robust in patients with greater decline in withdrawal severity. Our results support the clinical utility of mesocorticolimbic cue reactivity in monitoring the XR-NTX treatment outcomes and highlight the link between opioid withdrawal symptomatology and neural opioid cue reactivity.",NA,NA,NA,0,

Identifying subtypes of tobacco use disorder based on such factors may lead to better understanding of potential treatment targets, individualize treatments and improve outcomes. In this preliminary study, to identify potential subgroups, we applied hierarchical clustering to a broad range of assessments measuring personality, IQ and psychiatric symptoms, as well as various environmental and experiential characteristics from 102 otherwise healthy cigarette smokers. The identified subgroups were further compared on various resting-state fMRI measures from a subset (N = 65) of individuals who also underwent resting-state fMRI scanning. The clustering dendrogram indicated that smokers can be divided into three subgroups. Each subgroup had unique clinical assessment characteristics. The division yielded imaging differences between subgroups in the supplementary motor area/middle cingulate cortex and the cuneus. Regression analyses showed that amplitude of low frequency fluctuations in the supplementary motor area/middle cingulate cortex differed between groups and were negatively correlated with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale subscale Difficulty Describing Feelings.",NA,NA,NA,0,
